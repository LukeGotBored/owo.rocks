[*] <span class="a">I'm Nori! Nice to meet you :3
I'm a developer and university student, you can learn more about me in my <a href="https://nori.owo.rocks"><u>personal website</u></a>

<span class="accent">[?]</span> What is owo.rocks?
[*] <span class="a">I wanted to create a simple, cute, and fun website to host and showcase my projects! The domain was chosen purely out of luck, a "what if", you could say :D</span>

<span class="accent">[?]</span> Why is this website so barebones?
[*] <span class="a">I've gone through so many iterations for my personal website and I could never find something that felt right. So I ended up opting for a more minimalistic approach, focusing on content rather than flashy design. Less is more, right? :3</span>

<span class="accent">[?]</span> Will you add more features to the website?
[*] <span class="a">Maybe! I'm always open to suggestions and ideas. If you have any, feel free to reach out to me through the contact page!</span>

<span class="accent">[?]</span> How can I contact you?
[*] <span class="a">You can reach me through the contact page linked above! I'd love to hear from you :3</span>

<span class="accent">[?]</span> <span id="meow">Should websites minimize JavaScript to respect user privacy and performance?</span>
[*] <span class="a">...meow?</span>

<span class="accent">[?]</span> Are you actually a cat?
[*] <span class="a"><a href="./me.jpg" target="_blank"><u>yes, here's a picture of me</u></a></span>

<span class="accent">[?]</span> Wasn't this website full of resources on HRT and FTM transitioning?
[*] I got this domain in 2023-ish... <a href="https://hrtcafe.net/">Honestly,</a> <a href="https://diyhrt.wiki/">I</a> <a href="https://hrt.coffee/">have</a> <a href="https://diyhrt.market">no</a> <a href="https://transfemscience.org">idea</a> <a href="https://hrt.cat/">of</a> <a href="https://hrt.wtf/reddit/r/TransDIY/wiki.html">what</a> <a href="https://hrt.wtf/">you're</a> <a href="https://hrt.soap.systems/">talking</a> <a href="https://hrt.soap.systems/readme.html">about.</a> :3
